# Amazon Clone

A fully responsive Amazon Clone web application built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project aims to replicate the design and functionality of Amazon's homepage, including key features like navigation, product listings, banners, and footers. While it mimics the UI/UX of Amazon, it's a static website without backend integration.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Header & Navigation**: Includes search bar, logo, and navigation links similar to Amazon.
- **Product Listings**: Product grid with placeholders for images, titles, prices, and rating stars.
- **Promotional Banners**: Replicates Amazon's large hero banner section for promotions.
- **Footer**: Contains common links like "Help," "Terms & Conditions," and other informational links.
